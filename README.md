Overview

This project focuses on the analysis of historical stock data using advanced data manipulation and analysis techniques in Python. The dataset contains historical stock prices of major companies with key financial metrics. Our goal is to clean, process, and analyze the data to provide meaningful insights using advanced techniques like data joins, window functions, and aggregation.

The dataset includes approximately 20,000 rows of data for various companies across multiple dates. In addition, advanced data analysis was performed, such as:
	•	Data Cleaning: Removing missing values, handling incorrect data types, and ensuring data consistency.
	•	Data Joins: Merging data from multiple sources for deeper insights.
	•	Advanced Window Functions: Applying analytical functions like rolling averages, time-series calculations, and data summarization.
